*   This include lets you easily display an alert. To use this include no `.html` ending is necessary.
*
*   You can use the following kinds of alerts:
*
*    - secondary  (foundation built-in)
*    - primary  (foundation built-in)
*    - success  (foundation built-in)
*    - warning  (foundation built-in)
*    - alert    (foundation built-in)
*
*   You can even use markdown and <html>-tags inside the alert, but beware to use " and ' properly; for example:
*
*       {% include alert primary='Show an info alert with <b>outstanding</b> <a href="#info">information</a>.' %}
*
*       {% include alert primary='Show an info alert with *outstanding* [information](#info).' %}
*
*       {% include alert primary='Show an info alert with *outstanding* <a href="#info">information</a>.' %}
*
*   You can also call for additional classes to be put on the alert div:
*
*       {% include alert success="Yay! you did it!" classes='round' %}
*
{% endcomment %}
{% for entry in include %}
{% if entry[0] == 'classes' %}{% continue %}{% endif %}
<div class="{{ entry[0] }} {{ include.classes }}">{% if entry[0] contains 'terminal' %}{{ entry[1] }}{% else %}{{ entry[1] | markdownify }}{% endif %}</div>
{% endfor %}
